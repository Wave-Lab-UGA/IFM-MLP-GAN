## Abstract
In this project, an unsupervised-learning platform - generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed for experimental data augmentation in a deep-learning assisted photonic-based instantaneous microwave frequency measurement (IFM) system. Only 75 sets of experimental data are required and the GAN can augment the small amount of data into 5000 sets of data for training the deep learning model. Furthermore, frequency measurement error of the estimated frequency has improved by an order of magnitude from 50 MHz to 5 MHz. The proposed use of GAN effectively reduces the amount of experimental data needed by 98.75% and reduces measurement error by 10 times.
